This is GPU (CUDA) solver code from ISP RAS.  It aims to provide a
highly optimized implementation.

For now, only Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient with Approximate
Inverse preconditioner is provided.  The name of the solver to use
in fvSolution is "GPUPCG".  To make it available, load the library
in controlDict:

libs ("libispmCudaSolvers.so");


Components that can have little or no connection to foam-extend are
maintained separately at https://github.com/amonakov/ispm-sparse-lib

The above library needs to be built first, and ISPM_DIR environment
variable must point to its location.
